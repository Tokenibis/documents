* Conflict of Interest
** Purpose
The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect this
tax-exempt organization’s (Organization) interest when it is
contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might
benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the
Organization or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction.
This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable
state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to
nonprofit and charitable organizations.

** Definitions 
1. Interested Person - Any director, principal officer, or member of a
   committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct
   or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested
   person.
2. Financial Interest - A person has a financial interest if the
   person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment,
   or family:
   1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the
      Organization has a transaction or arrangement,
   2. A compensation arrangement with the Organization or with any
      entity or individual with which the Organization has a
      transaction or arrangement, or
   3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation
      arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the
      Organization is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.
Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as
gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. A financial interest is
not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person who has a financial
interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate
governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest
exists.

** Procedures
1. Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible
   conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the
   existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to
   disclose all material facts to the directors and members of
   committees with governing board delegated powers considering the
   proposed transaction or arrangement.
2. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. After disclosure
   of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any
   discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the
   governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a
   conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining
   board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest
   exists.
3. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest
   1. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing
      board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she
      shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote
      on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible
      conflict of interest.
   2. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if
      appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to
      investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or
      arrangement.
   3. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee
      shall determine whether the Organization can obtain with
      reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or
      arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to
      a conflict of interest.
   4. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not
      reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict
      of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by
      a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the
      transaction or arrangement is in the Organization’s best
      interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and
      reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall
      make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or
      arrangement.
4. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy
   1. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to
      believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible
      conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis
      for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain
      the alleged failure to disclose.
   2. If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further
      investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing
      board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose
      an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take
      appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
      
** Records of Proceedings
The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board
delegated powers shall contain: 
1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to
   have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible
   conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any
   action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was
   present, and the governing board’s or committee’s decision as to
   whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
2. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes
   relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the
   discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction
   or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with
   the proceedings.
   
** Compensation
1. A voting member of the governing board who receives
   compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Organization for
   services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that
   member’s compensation.
2. A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes
   compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or
   indirectly, from the Organization for services is precluded from
   voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.
3. No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose
   jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives
   compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Organization, either
   individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing
   information to any committee regarding compensation.

** Annual Statements
Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with
    governing board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement
    which affirms such person: 
1. Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy, 
2. Has read and understands the policy, 
3. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and 
4. Understands the Organization is charitable and in order to maintain
   its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities
   which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.
   
** Periodic Reviews
To ensure the Organization operates in a manner consistent with
charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could
jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted.
The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following
subjects: 
1. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable,
   based on competent survey information, and the result of arm’s
   length bargaining.
2. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with
   management organizations conform to the Organization’s written
   policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or
   payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do
   not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an
   excess benefit transaction.
** Use of Outside Experts
When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII,
the Organization may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside
experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of
its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

* Idemnification
** General

Columbia, the corporation shall indemnify any director, officer,
employee, or agent, or former member, director, officer, employee, or
agent of the corporation, or any person who may have served at the
corporation’s request as a director or officer of another corporation

agents, and persons is referred to in this Article individually as an
“indemnitee”), against expenses actually and necessarily incurred by
such indemnitee in connection with the defense of any action, suit, or
proceeding in which that indemnitee is made a party by reason of being
or having been such member, director, officer, employee, or agent,
except in relation to matters as to which that indemnitee shall have
been adjudged in such action, suit, or proceeding to be liable for
negligence or misconduct in the performance of a duty. The foregoing
indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an indemnitee may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement,
resolution of the Board of Directors, or otherwise.

** Expenses
Expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending
a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding may be paid by the
corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit,
or proceeding, if authorized by the Board of Directors, upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified hereunder.

** Insurance
The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a member, director, officer, employee, or agent
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by
such person in any such capacity or arising out of such person’s
status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power or
obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under this
Article.

The corporation shall keep complete books and records of account and
minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors.
