Although charity exists only by the grace of human compassion, we
believe that the most effective opportunity for permanent progress lies
in the unfeeling economic systems that shape its structure. In this
document, we describe a qualitative approach to contextualize the
mechanisms which have hindered the nonprofit sector to date. The
explanation derives from a concise statement: nonprofits create impact
but sell emotion. Our proposed solution is the novel conceptualization
of Universal Basic Philanthropy, an economic assertion that charitable
social influence is the natural right of all individuals. The claims are
audaciously grand: the efficiency of free market donations, answers to
the growing concern of wealth inequality, and the promise of a
revolutionary altruistic economy. The problem is evident, and the
societal benefits are beyond compelling. Universal Basic Philanthropy
can be more than an academic ideal. We intend to show that the reward
goes beyond theory, that the time to initiate change is today.


1 Introduction
==============

  Much of public debate concerning private charity donations addresses
  the question of how much to give. This issue remains divisive among
  Americans. However, regardless of public sentiment, contributes have
  hovered around a constant two percent rate for decades. Few Americans
  support changes to the tax deduction laws, which are an implicit
  signal by the government to encourage
  philanthropy[giving2018][zinsmeister2016almanac]. We do not take a
  stance on this debate. Instead, we would like to offer an outsider's
  perspective on a more universally agreeable challenge: how to make the
  existing two percent more effective. Improving efficiency in the
  nonprofit sector is a rich and complex field in its own
  right[herman2008advancing]. This work has been instrumental in guiding
  the industry to date, and we do not presume to improve on its specific
  findings. However, by drawing cross-disciplinary inspiration from
  ideas in classical economics and recent trends in the high-tech
  industry, we cautiously claim to have stumbled upon something of a
  silver bullet. Universal Basic Philanthropy, or UBP, is a simple
  concept; so simple that we were surprised by the lack of mention in
  any formal or informal literature. The premise is this: every month,
  all adult citizens within a jurisdiction receive a guaranteed stipend
  in the form of a charity currency that they must eventually donate to
  a philanthropic cause. Nonprofit organizations then convert the
  donations back into standard money to fund their mission. Although
  such a system would have been impractical for most of human history,
  the current explosion of interest in novel digital currencies has not
  only made ideas such as UBP feasible but culturally marketable as
  well[bonneau2015sok][nakamoto2008bitcoin]. The purpose of this paper
  is to provide a high-level but comprehensive argument that UBP will be
  a paradigm-shifting model for social progress.


2 Related Work
==============

  As a policy, UBP is comparable to three other progressive ideas in
  academic literature. Firstly, UBP is a specialization of the Universal
  Basic Income (UBI), a concept with a rich history of study that has
  recently garnered renewed interest. UBI proposes that, in place of
  welfare, the state should provide a steady sum of money to all adult
  individuals to cover minimal living expenses [van2004basic].
  Researchers have analyzed experiments in UBI across several
  small-scale experiments in such settings as
  Alaska[goldsmith2002alaska], Finland[koistinen2014good], and
  Namibia[osterkamp2013basic]. UBP also shares a common ideology with
  Richard Hasen's "democracy coupons" [hasen1996clipping], which has
  been deployed in the city of Seattle since 2015[douglas2016local].
  Whereas democracy coupons promote egalitarianism in the plutocratic
  campaign spending process, UBP attempts to do the same for
  philanthropy. Finally, UBP's charitable unit of currency has similar
  properties with the concept of time banking, where members of small
  communities reciprocate labor as measured by time rather than market
  value[cahn1992time]. UBP's currency may enable some of the same
  benefits by promoting community well-being[lasker2011time] and an
  individual sense of purpose[ozanne2010learning] --- but at a much
  larger scale.


3 Roadmap
=========

  We will first identify the problems that UBP promises to solve within
  the nonprofit sector. These take the form of three distinct effects
  that stem from one underlying cause. Next, we more formally describe
  the mechanics of UBP and how it can immediately mitigate the
  enumerated problems. The proceeding three sections will then cover
  categories of benefits:

  - UBP as a free-market mechanism for informed philanthropy
  - UBP as a solution for combating wealth and power inequality
  - UBP as the launching point for a parallel altruistic economy

  The paper concludes with a plan for the initial steps that Token Ibis
  as an organization intends to take in order to prove the efficacy of
  these ideas.


4 Problem Statement
===================

  The scope of this work addresses the section of the nonprofit industry
  that relies on private donations, a stream of money that totaled $410
  billion in the United States in 2018[giving2018]. This section
  identifies three distinct issues with the current state of the
  nonprofit sector. Throughout this paper, we will use the term
  "nonprofit" to reference only organizations or parts of organizations
  whose operation depends on this stream of freely given money. For
  example, most hospitals, although classified as nonprofits in the
  legal sense, receive most of their funding in exchange for the medical
  services that they provide. Although potentially relevant, we do not
  explicitly include these organizations in our discussion.


4.1 Irrational Causes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Most people would agree that philanthropy comes from the heart rather
  than the mind. Although this is a comforting thought for many reasons,
  the fact remains that the heart has evolved to be a poor organ for
  judging effectiveness. Purely empathy-driven charity can incur steep
  opportunity costs at best and do more harm than good at
  worst[batson1995immorality][bloom2017against]. This realization has
  led to the Effective Altruism movement, which favors uncompromising
  utilitarianism as the ideal model for giving[singer2010life]. Under
  the guidance of Peter Singer's philosophies, organizations such as
  GiveWell.com promote front-line nonprofits which can deliver the most
  "impact" for each dollar[navigator2009givewell]. This approach appears
  sound in theory. However, is Effective Altruism, in every sense,
  effective? In one crucial measure, it is quite the opposite. Although
  researchers continue to investigate the culprit psychological
  mechanisms, the literature overwhelmingly agrees that empathy plays a
  stronger role than logic in charitable giving[cameron2011escaping].
  This result should come as little surprise. However, more concerning
  to us is a powerful secondary effect, first observed by Small et al.
  In this seminal study, researchers exposed individuals to three
  different types of solicitations and gaged their willingness to
  donate:

  1. A single identifiable victim of famine named Rokia
  2. Statistical information about many victims of the same famine
  3. Both (1) and (2)

  As expected, the first approach elicited more donations than the
  second. However, quite discouragingly, the first scenario also proved
  far more effective than the third. Small and her colleagues showed
  that not only is logic ineffective, but it is also harmful to the
  cause[small2007sympathy]. The fact that emotion trumps logic in
  philanthropy is a quaint product of human nature. The fact that
  additional information is /detrimental/ indicates a strong possibility
  for deeper systematic problems.


4.2 Overhead
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The instinct of a loyal capitalist is to measure the competence of
  state and nonprofit organizations against the golden standard of the
  private sector. Typically, public perception, at least, will be found
  wanting[aaker2010nonprofits]. The story is that these public service
  organizations lack a clear bottom line to align organizational
  incentives as well as the financial abundance to retain quality
  resources and skilled workers. We do not presume to state whether
  these critiques are valid. However, we claim that even if nonprofits
  did have the same level of talent, resources, and organzational
  structure, there is a second, more fundamental obstacle that will
  always place them at a disadvantage.


4.3 Indeterminate Success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In the private sector, the end goal for an organization is
  straightforward: make as much money as possible. More precisely, the
  single correct measure for the worth of a for-profit company is its
  aggregated expected future profits adjusted for uncertainty and a
  diminishing time horizon. There is no such magic measuring stick for
  nonprofits. A well-known issue is that quantifying social impact is a
  challenging task. Indeed, the measurement of impact is one of the most
  significant research questions in modern
  philanthropy[lee2015framework]. However, even if research could create
  an ideal metric, a unit to measure social impact as precisely as the
  dollar measures profit, there is, once again, a second fundamental
  problem. Suppose that, for some given ideal measure of impact, /Org A/
  services 100 individuals with an annual budget of $100,000 while /Org
  B/ services 1,000 individuals on an annual budget of $10,000,000.
  Which is the more successful endeavor that a startup /Org C/ should
  try to emulate? There is no definitive answer. In the private sector,
  this question is meaningless; everybody wants to be more profitable in
  the absolute sense. Efficiency is only a means, not an end. In
  contrast, nonprofits must deal with the two-dimensional measuring
  stick of total impact as well as low overhead. Society cannot agree on
  what an ideal nonprofit should look like, let alone how to build it.


5 Problem Explanation
=====================

  At first glance, these three problems might seem unrelated. However,
  we claim that each one traces back to the same consequential
  observation: *nonprofits create impact but sell emotion.* In the
  private sector, a company creates a product and sells a product. Cafes
  make coffee and sell coffee; restaurants make food and sell food. On
  the other hand, despite the unimaginably rich diversity of people and
  causes that they support, nonprofits only have two consumer products
  in their inventory: self-congratulatory delight or relief from
  unbearable guilt. It is this inconsistency between what nonprofits
  produce and what they sell that lies at the heart of problems.


5.1 *Irrational Causes*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  What is the correct rational amount that a person should donate to
  charity? The answer depends on the individual's utility function. For
  example, the founders of the Effective Altruism movement claim to
  adopt a utility function that values a stranger's life far more than
  an expensive vacation. Hence, the life strategy of an Effective
  Altruist is to live as long as possible, make as much money as
  possible, and save as many lives as possible. For the rest of us who
  are motivated by family, knowledge, status, comfort, fame, etc., the
  calculus is more straightforward: the rational amount we should donate
  is precisely zero. Nonprofit workers subconsciously understand this
  dilemma. Consider the language often used by fundraising
  professionals: "what is the /least/ that you can do to make a
  difference? Surely, the well-being of an innocent child is worth more
  to you than that expensive dinner?" Emotionally, this is a compelling
  argument. But what about next week's expensive dinner, and the week
  after that? Charities realize that there is no "right" amount. The
  best they can do is coax their benefactors into being impulsive for
  just long enough to engage in accidental altruism.


5.2 *Overhead*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The need to create one product and sell another leads to substantial
  overhead costs. For instance, conventional wisdom in special events
  fundraising says that expenses can reach as high as one-third of the
  expected revenue and still qualify as a
  fundraiser[heyman2016nonprofit]. For a dinner gala, ticket sales
  typically cover only the expenses--- The bulk of the profit comes from
  corporate sponsorship and future opportunities to ask for money. Think
  about what this implies: a $100 ticket to an event may only represent
  the /opportunity/ to contribute to the cause. Again, this is a
  struggle that is unique to the nonprofit sector. Consider how
  expensive shoes would be if shoe salespeople needed to operate galas,
  5k runs, and mail campaigns just to put customers in the right
  mindset.


5.3 *Indeterminate Success*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Finally, our approach provides context for the dichotomy between /Org
  A/ and /Org B/: the former is probably better at creating impact while
  the latter is better at selling. One is doomed to toil away at their
  work in efficient obscurity while the other is a scandal and collapse
  waiting to happen[tinkelman2009unintended].


6 Approach
==========

  We will preface our solution with a final piece of context. Most
  philanthropists view the decision to give to charity as a single
  atomic action. The entire chain of thought from empathy to
  self-sacrifice and eventual gratification gets compressed into a
  single transfer of currency. This view has been dominant throughout
  the extent of human history. Today, we suggest that it would be more
  helpful to view philanthropy as two distinct mental processes:

  - *Commitment* - The decision to donate
  - *Allocation* - The choice of recipients for the donation

  Although it may seem like a subtle distinction, the two mental
  processes are categorically different. The commitment step is
  necessarily emotional. By agreeing to give away their hard-earned
  income, donors must weigh the gratification of altruism against their
  wants and needs. The allocation step, on the other hand, need not be
  purely emotional. If we can only provide individuals with the
  privilege of allocation without the stress of commitment, then we can
  allow them to finally focus on the merits of impact[1].


7 Universal Basic Philanthropy
==============================

  Our solution is as grand as it is simple, and is perhaps appropriately
  named /Universal Basic Philanthropy/. In this scheme, we propose that
  at some level of governance, the state should fund and distribute a
  guaranteed charitable stipend to its constituents. For concreteness,
  we will suppose that the United States Federal Government allocates
  two percent of the national GDP to all citizens via a digital
  platform. This sum translates to about $150 per month per person as of
  2019. Where UBP is the generic name of the distribution policy, we
  shall call the currency /Ibis/[2]. The dynamics of this system,
  enforced by a combination of legal and technical mechanisms, are as
  follows:
  1. Entities (individuals or organizations) may purchase more Ibis
     using USD at a fixed ratio exchange rate (e.g., 1:1).
  2. Entities may send Ibis to any other entity.
  3. Only a registered nonprofit organization may trade Ibis for USD at
     an officially approved exchange.
  4. Entities must pay interest and capital gains on Ibis investments
     with more Ibis.
  5. The exchange of Ibis for USD or other material goods on a secondary
     market is prohibited.

  UBP creates a market infrastructure for individuals to focus on the
  rational decision of allocation rather than the emotional struggle of
  commitment. Its tangible medium, the Ibis token, enjoys all of the
  flexibility of the US dollar with the exception that only registered
  nonprofit can extract its monetary value. With these simple tools, we
  can simultaneously eliminate each of the three problems that we
  identified.

  - *Irrational Cause* - By construction, the decision to allocate UBP,
    which is given rather than earned, is categorically more rational
    than the choice to both commit and allocate traditionally acquired
    money. The result is smarter donations flowing toward causes with
    the greatest need.
  - *Overhead* - By pushing a fixed amount of money to the nonprofit
    sector at a national scale, the government alleviates the need for
    the industry to invest heavily in fundraising. Nonprofits still have
    to compete for funding with each other, but this fundraising and
    marketing effort is more comparable to baseline competition in the
    private sector.
  - *Indeterminate Success* - As a consequence of solving the
    /irrational causes/ problem, the nonprofits that scale will be the
    ones in the best position to market their work. We expect that
    growth will eventually correlate more with effectiveness and less
    with emotional salesmanship. The result is that the public can
    finally agree on a single metric for evaluating nonprofits: total
    impact.

  The complementary ideas of UBP and Ibis together form the basis for
  our proposed philanthropic world order, one built on the principles of
  economics rather than idealism, one effective by design rather than
  hope. In this world, the power of donation and social influence is a
  right, not a sacrifice. The responsibility of informed social
  influence is a duty as sacred as democratic participation and
  community stewardship. This paradigm is the norm that we wish to
  advocate, one that addresses the root problems of the old while laying
  the foundations for a tantalizing future of genuine systematic
  progress.


8 Free Market Allocation Engine
===============================

  This section describes the first of three categories of societal
  benefits enabled by UBP. Currently, nonprofits receive money through
  one of two sources: grants from centralized grantmaking organizations
  and direct donations from individuals. UBP presents a more robust
  alternative that leverages the virtuous dynamics of a free market. At
  its core, UBP predicts that if society pushes enough money through
  interacting autonomous agents in the name of philanthropy, the results
  will be overwhelmingly positive.


8.1 Smart Money
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  While grantmaking benefits from the input of expert decision makers,
  it suffers from the well-studied local knowledge problem[3]. On the
  other hand, direct donations by individuals lack an explicit mechanism
  to aggregate information. As in democratic voting, the qualifications
  of the average participant roughly determines the effectiveness of the
  system as a whole. UBP is a market-based mechanism to align resources
  with knowledge in much the same way that capitalism tries to align
  money with talent. While all individuals receive an equal stipend, we
  should /not/ expect that everyone will donate the same amount.
  Remember: Ibis is allowed to change hands between individuals,
  allowing money to move from the people who have it to the people who
  want it. In the traditional economy, currency flows from the foolish
  and desperate to the clever and greedy. In the Ibis economy, it flows
  from the indifferent and uninformed to the passionate and engaged, a
  setup that is favorable to everyone [4]. If the Ibis ecosystem can
  reach a point in which front-line volunteers serve as the endpoint for
  most of the country's philanthropic output, then what we would have is
  a robust free-market mechanism to both measure and reward nonprofits
  for demonstrable effectiveness.


8.2 Promoting Engagement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The majority of the benefits enumerated in this document cite
  inanimate economic mechanisms. However, we have little doubt that the
  most impressive initial effects will occur at the sociological level.
  Namely, the financial gift of philanthropy is the most effective and
  scalable method we can imagine to promote volunteerism. A 2015 study
  by Fidelity confirms our natural intuition that donating and
  volunteering are deeply intertwined. The researchers found that 79% of
  donors reported volunteering in the same year as compared to 25% of
  all Americans. Furthermore, 58% of individuals say they donated to an
  organization before volunteering, suggesting that money is a catalyst
  rather than an afterthought[fund2015time]. If this correlation has
  even some causal power, then UBP will initiate a sustainable increase
  in volunteerism[5].


9 Wealth Equality
=================

  In its most recently reported measurement in 2016, The Federal Reserve
  Bank of Saint Louis document the highest GINI index for national
  wealth inequality in the modern era[fred2016gini]. Wealth inequality
  is, of course, a highly complex and contentious topic within economics
  and political science. While we do not formally endorse any particular
  policies aside from vanilla UBP, we outline three reasons why
  variations on UBP may be an attractive tool in this space.


9.1 Democratizing Philanthropy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Although wealth inequality continues to be a popular topic in
  mainstream discussion, inequality in philanthropy is often ignored.
  Gifts from wealthy donors accounted for over a quarter of total
  nonprofit revenue in 2015 according to Giving USA[callahan2017givers].
  The trend is equally worrisome. Between 2003 and 2013, total
  contributions from individuals with a net income greater than $100,000
  increased by 40% while contributions from the rest of the population
  declined by 34%[collins2016gilded]. This growing generosity by wealthy
  individuals is admirable at a personal level; better schools and
  museums than yachts and private jets. However, perhaps society as a
  whole should reevaluate a system in which a small fraction of affluent
  donors can unilaterally decide the future of education, news, health,
  and welfare for large sections of the population[6]. Should
  philanthropy look more like capitalism, in which a person's influence
  is proportional to the sum of their financial assets? Or should it
  look more like democracy, in which a person's influence, in principle,
  is the same for every individual? While personal wealth predominately
  affects the owner, political and philanthropic influence both have
  consequences for society as a whole. We believe the answer is clear
  and claim that UBP is the single most elegant strategy to create a
  more egalitarian paradigm of social influence.


9.2 Wealth Redistribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  While vanilla UBP reduces philanthropic inequality by design, the Ibis
  infrastructure as a whole provides a potential solution for the more
  general problem of wealth inequality. In 2019, rhetoric among the
  Democratic party for pre-Reagan-era taxes on the ultra-wealthy
  continues to escalate, most notably highlighted by Rep.
  Ocasio-Cortez's proposal for a 70% income tax[de2019cost]. Critics of
  such proposals point out concerns that these rates would prohibitively
  stifle incentives for economic growth. Although we at Token Ibis do
  not hold an official position concerning this policy, we can suggest a
  theoretical compromise. We propose that, after collecting the 70%
  income tax, the state gives back a significant fraction of the revenue
  to the individual in the form of an Ibis tax return. Call it
  "mandatory altruism." As a mechanism for combating wealth inequality,
  mandatory altruism would be equally effective as a traditional tax. On
  the other hand, while not as powerful as plain money, social influence
  can be a sufficient incentive on its own[blackburn2010giving]. In /The
  Givers/[callahan2017givers], David Callahan argues that philanthropy
  is often something of an afterthought for the ultra-rich after they
  have accumulated their fortunes in other industries. The result in yet
  another level of misalignment between means and knowledge. Our
  mandatory altruism scheme provides a tangible incentive for aspiring
  capitalists to apply their talent and business acumen toward social
  good even as they are building their more profitable enterpises[7].


9.3 Social Influence as Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Finally, we believe that Ibis may play a role in giving due credit to
  true philanthropists. Forbes magazine famously publishes a yearly
  report of the wealthiest men and women on Earth, a report that
  seemingly only exists to satiate our obsession with rich and powerful
  figures. We believe that the same publication measuring wealth in Ibis
  can have the same effect for promoting philanthropy. In a similar
  vein, there has been much debate over how to compensate successful
  nonprofit executives. Outspoken industry leaders such as Dan Pallotta
  believe the answer is to reward executives in the same way that the
  for-profit sector rewards their superstar
  managers[pallotta2009uncharitable]. We respectfully disagree. The
  nonprofit sector depends on donor trust, implying the need for a level
  of self-sacrifice on the part of the employees. However, if
  organizations cannot reward their most distinguished workers with
  material wealth, then perhaps they can at least signal importance and
  status. A salary of $100,000 for an outstanding CEO, accompanied by a
  $400,000 bonus delivered in Ibis, is economic proof that the
  organization values its leader at $500,000. If nonprofit workers must
  sacrifice personal wealth for the greater good, we can at least offer
  them meaningful proof of their worth.


10 Altruistic Economics
=======================

  8 and 9 address reforms that Ibis and UBP enable within the existing
  establishment. However, perhaps the most exciting feature of Ibis is
  its ability to foster new institutions and financial patterns
  altogether. The setting for this opportunity lies in the intersection
  between money and human psychology. Although we recognize money as an
  indispensable component of modern society, most people hold some level
  of stigma against excessive greed and indulgence. This stigma
  necessarily holds across all forms of money, from fiat to gold and
  Bitcoin. Ibis promises to be a large-scale exception to the rule. With
  the advent of the world's first charitable currency, we see the
  potential for an incarnation of money that is fundamentally free from
  greed and selfishness, in effect, an otherwise fully-featured medium
  of exchange that fosters exclusively altruistic interactions.


10.1 Direct Exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The opportunity to break down monetary stigma begins with direct
  exchanges between individuals. In particular, we are interested in
  situations where an economic transaction fails to take place due to
  social or moral complications.

  - Alice needs her friend Bob to help her with homework, but he needs
    some extra motivation.
  - Carol wants to buy a used desk from her friend, Dave, but has no
    idea how much to pay.
  - Erin needs to give away possessions that belonged to her recently
    deceased husband, Frank, but it feels wrong to sell it for cold,
    hard money.
  - Grace is a casual gambler, but her state places strict regulations
    on local casinos.
  - Heidi is an amateur political guru who wants to bet on Ivan2020's
    platform on UBP, but she ran into federal laws banning political
    gambling[ozimek2014regulation].
  - Judy wants to buy Mike's concert ticket, but cannot legally offer a
    different price higher than the original sale[nmsa2015ticket].

  In another class of interpersonal interactions, individuals exchange
  money primarily as a means to signal appreciation. This mechanism is
  reminiscent of the salary status signaling mentioned in 9.3.

  - Nick is a middle school teacher who wants to give out monetary
    science fair awards, but he is unsure about local policies for
    paying underage students.
  - Olivia runs a bug bounty program for a large tech company. Although
    her company hands out millions of dollars in bounties, the weekend
    bounty hunters are working for far less than minimum wage, and she
    realized that they are more interested in reputation than material
    gain.
  - Oscar is going to attend a funeral and wants to share his
    sympathies, but he feels that bringing more flowers would be a waste
    of money.
  - Pat needs to buy a birthday gift for his girlfriend, Sybil, but he
    is a practical man and does not want to overspend to prove his
    commitment[8].
  - Trent is trying to increase user reviews on his e-commerce site and
    is trying to offer $1 credit for each submission. Trent's plan is
    currently failing and he wonders if there is some other way he could
    convince people to leave feedback[9].

  Each of these examples represents generic situations in which Ibis
  likely serves as a superior medium of exchange to traditional money.
  The cases we listed are far from comprehensive, and one of the more
  exciting aspects of a UBP/Ibis future is the potential for unexpected
  business models to emerge. Here is a small taste: in 2015, NPR's
  Planet Money podcast reported a story on Haystack, an app that tried
  to optimize public parking. The app worked by allowing drivers who
  were pulling out from crowded parking spaces to sell their vacated
  spot to drivers who were pulling in. Although the company was, by most
  measures, an entrepreneurial success, the operation was eventually
  shut down due to public outrage over its core business strategy:
  generating financial profit from free public goods[money2015episode].
  The Haystack story represents a victory for ordinary human
  sensibilities at the price of economic efficiency. We believe we can
  revive the Haystack model, but this time with Ibis. By removing greed
  from the equation, Ibis can enable a real economic solution to a
  multi-billion dollar parking industry. We suspect that Haystack is
  only one of a vast space of business models that Ibis can unlock.


10.2 Banking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Banking is another sector with abundant opportunities for innovation
  under the UBP/Ibis ecosystem. As with standard money, recipients of
  UBP may not want to spend their Ibis every month, opting instead to
  save their income for grander or more personally meaningful
  donations[10]. We expect that consumer banking services will emerge to
  fill the need for savings and checking accounts. These institutions
  will provide convenient money management services on the consumer side
  while using the deposits to offer low-interest loans to nonprofits.
  Since this agreement takes place under the Ibis umbrella, interest
  payments to any party are legally required to take the form of more
  Ibis, effectively preventing any individual or for-profit entity from
  receiving traditional financial gain. The institutions providing these
  services will be some combination of conventional banks looking to
  earn positive PR and philanthropically motivated nonprofit enterprises
  in the mold of our Ibis parking app startup from 10.1. As Muhammad
  Yunus so compelling demonstrated, the application of finance to
  charitable causes can be as exciting as it is
  impactful[yunus2007banker]


10.3 Venture Philanthropy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It is fitting that we end the body of this discussion in the most
  relevant area for Token Ibis as an organization. Innovation thrives
  when the current establishment provides daring newcomers with the
  means to build their ideas. In the current system, an aspiring
  nonprofit startup only has one way to obtain those means: by begging.
  This model is problematic for Token Ibis. We have no photogenic
  constituents or dire current events to aid in our fundraising.
  However, what we have is an immensely valuable and economically
  (non)profitable idea. In a future in which we've succeeded, the next
  generation of aspiring social entrepreneurs will have full access to
  the vibrant ecosystem of angel investors and venture firms that their
  for-profit counterparts enjoy today. Investors who see promise in a
  startup will have the opportunity to purchase equity in exchange for
  startup capital. If the enterprise becomes wildly successful, it will
  eventually earn more direct donations than it needs to operate and pay
  out dividends to its shareholders. All of this takes place under the
  Ibis umbrella. As in 10.2, none of the parties gain a single cent of
  monetary gain. What they do receive is proof of their business acumen
  in the nonprofit sector accompanied by the returns to create even more
  social influence for the benefit of the greater good. In a world in
  which nonprofit equities are commonplace, it follows that we will see
  the rise of nonprofit bonds, publicly traded nonprofits, shorts, and
  nonprofit mutual funds[11]. Long influenced by giants of the finance
  and tech industries, the nonprofit sector might soon get its own
  Silicon Valley and its own Wall Street.


11 A Path Forward
=================

  At a theoretical level, the ambition of the ideas in this paper lies
  somewhere between bold and absurd. In practice, there are myriad
  reasons why even good intentions are doomed to fail, especially given
  the magnitude of political and cultural changes proposed by UBP.
  However, Rome was not built in a day. Before Universal Basic Income
  was championed by the likes of Elon Musk and Mark
  Zuckerberg[clifford2017billionaires], before it headlined the platform
  of a U.S. presidential candidate[yang2018war], UBI was best described
  as series of hopeful experiments. If our survey is accurate, then the
  concept of UBP is much earlier in its life than UBI was at the turn of
  the century. There is much work to be done. The mission of Token Ibis
  is to prove the social value of Universal Basic Philanthropy at a
  meaningful scale. Our task is threefold:

  1. Raise generic philanthropic funds from interested donors
  2. Establish collaborative ties with local nonprofits
  3. Distribute UBP to members of a closely interacting population. We
     have identified colleges as an ideal setting for our study.

  The concrete implementation of our system is a custom web application
  for digital payments, donations, and peripheral engagement[12]. Under
  this setup, we have the full flexibility to conduct randomized trials
  for answering crucial research questions.

  - Does UBP increase engagement?
  - Does UBP promote more rational giving?
  - Does Ibis flow toward users who are more passionate, qualified, and
    engaged in nonprofit?
  - Does the flow of Ibis correlate with edges in the social network?

  Token Ibis offers the most long-term value as a rigorous testbed for
  evaluating UBP. However, despite this prioritization on research, we
  cannot lose sight of the immediate potential for UBP to benefit the
  community by promoting profoundly new levels of connection between
  donors, distributors, and nonprofits. We look forward to witnessing
  the fruits of an impact-focused local nonprofit ecosystem, at the
  indicators of empowerment when disadvantaged school children can one
  day exercise their right to social influence. Regardless of political
  cooperation or academic consensus, we intend to see Ibis to its full
  potential.


12 Conclusion
=============

  In this work, we contextualize the systematic shortcomings of the
  nonprofit sector under one fundamental insight, present a novel
  solution, and illustrate the new art of the possible under our
  currency-driven model. Although the endeavor is unapologetic in
  idealism and audacious in scale, our hope is this paper, in
  conjunction with our entrepreneurial efforts, will serve as a
  sufficient catalyst for the change that is to come.



Footnotes
_________

[1] Private foundations are an excellent modern day example for
studying the distinction between charitable commitment and allocation.
When Bill and Melinda Gates make their annual decision to donate /X/
billions of dollars to "philanthropy," it is an occasion for praise
and fanfare which has little basis on rationality. What the Gates
Foundation does with the money, however, is a thoughtful and
analytical process for the betterment of civilization. From this
perspective, UBP is a way to leverage technology for all individuals
to run their private foundation.

[2] Ibis is to the dollar as UBP is to Universal Basic Income. One is
a unit of currency and the other is a governance policy. Ibis is a
neutral name, and our process for choosing it was about as rational as
the average charity donation.

[3] We use this terminology to refer to the phenomenon by which
centralized decision makers, despite their superior qualifications and
education, struggle to use the local knowledge available to actors at
the ground level[hayek1945use].

[4] For concreteness, consider a hypothetical relationship between
Alice, the wealthy regional manager of some corporation and Bob, her
college-age nephew who actively volunteers through his university.
Alice has an abundance of money to donate on top of her UBP but very
little time to actively engage in charity. Bob has the time and
education, but little money. Eventually, we would expect that some
Ibis gets transferred from Alice to Bob, perhaps in the form of
birthday presents or supplementary payments for babysitting services.
We would not expect that Ibis should ever flow in the opposite
direction.

[5] An early criticism we have received on UBP is that it removes the
genuine humanity from a freely given donation. Our view is that cold,
hard, money is a poor substitute for humanity; people can get far more
psychological benefits from volunteering their time instead. Let money
be money, and let human connections be human connections.

[6] As a side note, we point out that the existing policy for
charitable tax deduction disproportionally benefits the wealthy by
design.

[7] We should point out that the suggestions of this section stand in
direct opposition to the ideas in 9.1. However, we argue that both are
an improvement to the current situation and believe that either might
be useful for future policymakers.

[8] Both the funeral and birthday examples are similar to existing
popular practices. While funeral donations "in lieu of flowers" have a
longer history, digital platforms such as Facebook have begun
investing in birthday fundraisers [ceballosdigital]. A number of
smaller organizations also offer charity gift cards
[charitygift2019][globalgiving2019][tisbest2019]. We are immensely
encouraged by all of these projects and view them as important
precursors to a more unified Ibis (or Ibis-like) infrastructure.

[9] The connection between this example and Ibis is probably the least
intuitive. The thought process is this: one dollar is just one dollar.
However, in the context of an already altruistic action like leaving
product reviews, perhaps one dollar of Ibis attaches just enough
additional moral encouragement to perform the original altruistic
action in the first place.

[10] In 2016, the Federal Reserve reported that the mean household
income in the U.S. was $102,700. The mean household wealth held in
bank accounts was $40,200 [bricker2017changes]. A similar
income/savings ratio for UBP would imply a $160 billion market for
Ibis banking.

[11] Note that these suggestions depend on the assumption that UBP
adequately addresses the problem from4.3. The only situation in which
we advocate for such complex financial setups is one in which money is
an acceptably accurate proxy for nonprofit impact.

[12] Along with the core payment platform, our application features
social media integration along with integrated nonprofit news feeds
and event postings. Together, these additional components provide
valuable data as natural proxies for engagement and social network
context, respectively.
