This document covers highlights what we intend to accomplish as an organization.
Aside from the /Executive Summary/, which introduces the model, all other sections function best as a self-contained reference.
This business plan covers the operations of the organization itself.

* Executive Summary
Token Ibis is an all-volunteer social profit organization with a mission to democratize philanthropy.
We believe that the current institution has three major shortcomings.

- *Power:* Social issues and services affect everyone, but decision-making power depends on private wealth.
- *Autonomy:* Unilateral power in philanthropy undermines already-marginalized populations and deny self-determination from those seeking services. 
- *Information:* Lack of data makes it difficult for grant-making institutions to determine which organizations and causes require the most attention.

We believe there is a silver bullet: explicitly place the decision-making into the hands of everyday citizens.
What would social profit look like if every individual received free money to contribute to the organizations and causes that they value?
The mission of Token Ibis is to explore this radical model at a manageable scale.
Our core business model works like this:

1. Raise money from traditional philanthropic funding sources.
2. Distribute money to everyday individuals.
3. Allow individuals to donate money to local nonprofits of their choosing.

[[./figures/flow.png]]

By leveraging modern technology, we can explore the benefits of Universal Basic Philanthropy in a highly practical experiment.
Our flagship product is a free digital platform that can facilitate this business model at relatively large scales.
In this document, we outline an ambitious three-phase roadmap to transition from a minimum viable product to a nation-wide social movement.
Due to our confidence in the potential of this project, our board of directors has committed to provide the voluntary time and overhead funding to carry out this mission indefinitely.
Moving forward, the plan calls for collaboration at multiple levels including donors, nonprofits, schools, and other movements pushing similar values.

Our goal is to demonstrate the power of UBP so well that other organizations across the country will have no choice but to try to replicate it. 
In this space, there is no competition, only progress.
To our prospective collaborators, the value proposition is simple.
Token Ibis can make every charitable dollar count twice: once to fund social profit today, and once to inspire a brand new model for tomorrow.

* Business Model & Technology
This section describes the design of the business model and the enabling technology.
The primary motivating principle of our design is /ease-of-use/.
Unlike other social endeavors, which are often (necessarily) labor-intensive, our strategy is to leverage our organizational strength in technology to do the heavy-lifting.
Ideally, we should have a product that is both practical to deploy and effortless to use.

** User Process
Users will be able to get on board and make an impact immediately without needing any prior knowledge about nonprofits or philanthropy.

Over time, we expect the process itself to positively reinforce behavior.

1. *Receive*: Every week, Token Ibis provides money to active users.
2. *Donate*: Users explore nonprofits and allocate donations to organizations of their choosing.
3. *Engage*: By giving them a financial voice, we encourage users to earn more money, deposit their own and engage with nonprofits in even more ways.

** Operator Process
In addition to creating a smooth experience for users, we also want to minimize the overhead effort in operating the project, both for ourselves and for future organizations.
Consequently, we have streamlined the operational process to the following steps:

1. *Add Nonprofits*: Network with a representative cross-section of local nonprofits to add to the platform.
2. *Onboard Users*: Brief users at the beginning of the semester to register them on the web app.
3. *Make Donations*: On a monthly basis, track nonprofit allocations that have exceeded $100 and send the money to each organization off-channel.
4. *Analyze Results*: Continually analyze app activity to improve user experience.

** Digital Platform
Software is the glue to Token Ibis's business model.
Our organization's primary product is a mobile web application that enables users to participate in philanthropy on an accessible, fun, and interactive platform.
On January 11, 2020, we released the Beta version of our app, which is available at https://app.tokenibis.org and pictured in Figure \ref{fig:screenshots}.

*** App Functionality
The app supports three main types of activity for users: /giving/ money to nonprofits, /sending/ money to other users, or /engaging/ in non-financial ways.
The navigational structure looks like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\dirtree{%
.1 Home.
.2 Organizations.
.3 Organizations.
.3 News.
.3 Events.
.2 People.
.3 People.
.3 Donations.
.3 Posts.
.2 Bots.
.3 Bots.
.3 Rewards.
.3 Activities.
}
\end{minipage}
#+END_EXPORT

As users explore the app, they will find that they can perform the following actions:

- *Donate*: Donate some amount of money to a listed nonprofit. We require users to type in a description, which could provide useful contextual insights.
- *Post*: Publicly post written content that other users can view next to the officially sanctioned news and events.
- *Earn*: By interacting with bots in the activities tab, particularly interested users can find more ways to earn philanthropy dollars.
- *Comment*: Publicly comment on any donation, transaction, news, event, post, or other comment.
- *Follow*: Follow other users or nonprofits to receive activity notifications and convenient filtering options.
- *RSVP*: Publicly announce intent to participate upcoming events and receive reminder notifications.
- *Like*: Publicly "like" any donation, transaction, news, event, post, or comment.
- *Bookmark*: Privately save news, events, or posts for future viewing using filters.
- *Deposit*: Add philanthropy dollars to their account through a credit/debit card deposit directly on the app.
 
*** App Technology Stack
The main platform has two parts: a backend /API/ server that defines the state of the system and a frontend /App/ server that provides the official user interface.
The type of app is a /progressive web app/\footnote{A progressive web app is a fairly new type of app which is accessible via a web browser but has the look and feel for a native mobile application}.
In addition, we are working on a dashboard to show off aggregate statistics from the API to the public, and may add more specialized applications in the future.

We developed the software in-house using 100% open-source frameworks and libraries.
Table [[tab:stack]] lists the main components of the technology stack.

#+name: tab:stack
#+CAPTION: *App Technology Stack.*
|--------------------+--------------|
| *Frontend*         | React JS     |
| *Backend*          | Django       |

| *Operating System* | Ubuntu 18.04 |
|--------------------+--------------|

All Ibis code is free and open-source under the GPLv3 license and available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/Tokenibis}.

*** App Integrations
A challenging, but vital, aspect of modern software development is the ability to integrate with other, more popular platforms.
To that end, our software suite integrates with, or plans to integrate with, the following services:

- *Google*: login, maps, email notifications
- *Facebook*: login
- *Microsoft*: Outlook (UNM/CNM) login
- *Paypal*: User deposits
- *Miscellaneous*: quotes API, prices API

*** Bot Program
The primary way to add new features to the platform is through the ibots interface.  
Token Ibis treats bots as a third type of entity (along with users and nonprofits) which can post send /rewards/ to users for engaging in various activities.
We will eventually open the bot platform to third-party contributors through the /ibots/ SDK\footnote{https://pypi.org/project/ibots/}.

** Distribution Strategy
Token Ibis distributes UBP payouts on a weekly basis at the same time every week (currently Fridays at 12:00 AM MT) using two automated distribution algorithms.
The first algorithm, which governs the total UBP payout, is a PID control algorithm which ensures that the steady-state user donations approaches our weekly target\footnote{PID controllers are typically used to control physical systems like thermostats or the cruise control on a car. Intuitively, our PID implementation increases or decreases the global payout amount dynamically to gradually adjust the money that users actually donate}.
Our second algorithm, which allocates the total amount to each user, employs an exponential back-off strategy to reward the most recently active users where activity is measured by whether a user makes a donation each week.

** Supporting Activities
In addition to operating this core business model, Token Ibis engages in two other auxiliary activities.

*** Public Awareness
A crucial aspect of our long-term mission is to spread awareness about the promise of UBP.
We will continue to add to our existing blog content and share it with our growing social media following.
Once we have established the pilot project, we intend to pursue more serious marketing approaches, likely with the help of Google Ad Grants.
Given enough momentum, we believe that UBP has the potential to draw significant public interest.

*** Academic Research 
All good policy ideas begin with sound experimentation.
In the grand scheme of things, Token Ibis's most important contribution will be a scientifically rigorous case study for UBP.
By creating a naturally scalable but controlled proprietary platform, our model provides a unique opportunity for social scientists to study charitable behavior.
As we accumulate users, Token Ibis will work closely with researchers, especially those based out of the University of New Mexico, to explore the academic foundations of UBP. 

* Partnering Organizations
This section lists external organizations with whom we currently have formal or informal connections to help us accomplish our mission.

** Upstream Donors
Although we are not actively fundraising at the moment, we have already received incredibly generous support from the community.

\avatar{figures/avatars/individuals}{Individual Donors}{Individual donors (outside of the board) have contributed approximately 2000 USD to the platform to date.}
#+END_EXPORT

** Peer Collaborators
In a typical for-profit business plan, this subsection might be called "competitors".
Instead, as a social profit organization, we hope to initiate collaboration when and wherever possible.
The following are organizations are working toward similar goals to increase participation in philanthropy.

/The following list includes organizations with whom we have individual contacts./
/We do *not* necessarily claim to have official partnerships with the organizations themselves./

** Downstream Nonprofit Organizations
In addition to creating the social impact that justifies our model, these partners provide an invaluable connection for synergistic marketing, fundraising, and knowledge-sharing.
The following list shows the organizations that we are already working with.
We maintain at least one contact in each organization who is familiar with our mission.

#+END_EXPORT

We plan to expand this list as we secure more funding and partnerships with educational institutions.
Eligible organizations must:

- Have active 501(c)(3) status
- Be headquartered in the greater ABQ area
- Have been vetted by a trusted 3rd-party organizations such as the United Way, the ABQ Foundation, the city of ABQ, or the UNM Foundation.
- Refrain from engaging in significant political advocacy

Beyond these minimum requirements, we also strive to create a well-balanced and engaging portfolio of nonprofits for our users.
Moving forward, the bulk of our nonprofit additions will likely be user-driven.

* Roadmap
This section outlines our tentative vision for how progress will unfold.
We expect gradual transitions and significant overlap between each phase tabulated in Table [[tab:phases]].
As of the writing of this document, Token Ibis is midway through Phase I and preparing for phase II.

#+name: tab:phases
#+CAPTION: *Phase Scopes*
|-------------+---------------------+----------------|
|             | *Weekly Budget ($)* | *Active Users* |
|-------------+---------------------+----------------|
| *Phase I*   |           1000-2000 |           <100 |
| *Phase II*  |              10000+ |          1000+ |
| *Phase III* |            variable |       variable |
|-------------+---------------------+----------------|

** Phase I: Explore
The goal of Phase I is explore the impact space and fine-tune our mission.
Although resources are limited in this phase, we enjoy flexibility and low communication overhead.
This is the time to enumerate the challenges that we face and commit to a long-term model.
As of this writing, we have completed two major pivots as a result of considerable dialog with nonprofit professionals.
The Token Ibis team, support base, and digital platform have all remained active and functional through both pivots.
We feel that the current iteration of UBP and the surrounding business model are beginning to solidify.

** Phase II: Scale
Having committed to a watertight message and business model, the next challenge is to scale up the ecosystem.
This process entails expanding three key resources:

1. Donor dollars
2. Nonprofit connections
3. User activity

Once we achieve a user base of 1000+ active individuals, we anticipate ample opportunity to achieve major press and make nation-wide connections.
Additionally, we will have rigorous quantitative data to analyze the key features of UBP.

** Phase III: Replicate
In the third phase, we will package our software and business model so that any interested organization can replicate it.
Token Ibis will provide low-cost consulting services to deploy our own software.

UBP can be deployed by any organization that has funding, nonprofit connections, and a population of interested users---features that describe most foundations and United Ways.
On our end, Token Ibis can supply free software, marketing materials, and lessons learned.
In return, we will encourage organizations to allow us to aggregate public donor data so that we can pursue even more meaningful analyses at scale.
Whereas a single organization can only grow so quickly, the spread of ideas and software is practically unbounded.

* Revenue & Expenses
This section describes our fundraising requirements and costs.
The overview is simple: Token Ibis has next to no overhead, so we are free to re-purpose all incoming donor money into philanthropy dollars for our users.

Table [[tab:operating]] shows Token Ibis's core operating costs.
Although we itemize these expenses for the sake of transparency, the intent is to show that our overall annual budget is essentially negligible.

#+name: tab:operating
#+CAPTION: *Annual Core Operating Costs.*
|--------------------+------------|
| *Expense*          | *Cost ($)* |
|--------------------+------------|
| Stationary         |        300 |
| P.O. Box           |        170 |
| Computing Services |        150 |
| Membership Fees    |         50 |
| Filing Fees        |         25 |

|--------------------+------------|
| Total              |        705 |
|--------------------+------------|
#+TBLFM: @8$2=vsum(@2..@-1)

The one variable cost that we do not include in Table [[tab:operating]] is marketing.
Depending on the mission need, we might want to devote a large amount of effort and money to spreading awareness.
Any costly campaigns of this type will occur at the discretion of the board members funding them.

* Impact Space
This section covers a broad overview of the "markets" that we care about.\footnote{Although Token Ibis intends to operate primarily in Albuquerque, due to the nature of the available data, most of the discussion in this section is about New Mexico as a whole.}
In particular, we want to understand the size of the community that we are working with by consulting several recent reports from local research organizations.
The general narrative is this:

1. The nonprofit sector is a necessary and vibrant component of the local community.
2. There is plenty of philanthropic capacity in this state.
3. Our users are the best vehicle for pumping philanthropic dollars into the nonprofit sector.
 
** Nonprofits
The nonprofit sector is a staple of the New Mexican economy.
According to a report by UNM's Bureau of Business & Economic Research, New Mexico is home to 1,785 nonprofits employing 62,445 workers and contributing $3.22 billion to the state's GDP (3.2%) [[cite:nmag2018philanthropy]].
Figure [[fig:nonprofit]] plots employment numbers for the local nonprofit sector after removing the less donation-dependent organizations that are outside of our domain.

#+name: fig:nonprofit
#+CAPTION: *NM Nonprofit Employees by NTEE Sector.* From BBER's original report, we omitted the following NTEE codes: Healthcare, Recreation & Sports, Mutual Membership Benefit.
[[./figures/employment_categories.png]]

** Philanthropy
Next, we will discuss the two major sources of funding: foundations and individual giving.
The purpose of this overview is to understand the fundraising market for Token Ibis.

*** Foundations
According to a 2018 report by the NM Association of Grantmakers report, foundations spent \approx $177.1 million in New Mexico.
Of this amount, \approx 83% came from out-of-state.
In Figure [[fig:foundations]], we borrow a graphic that shows the 277 foundations in New Mexico broken down by their 2015 giving volume.

#+name: fig:foundations
#+CAPTION: *NM Foundations by Giving Range.*
[[./figures/foundation_ranges.png]]

*** Individuals
Giving USA, a yearly report on national charitable giving, indicates that individual giving as a whole tends to be much higher than foundational grantmaking [[cite:giving2019]].
This ratio seems to hold for New Mexico as well.
The latest IRS tax return data from 2017 reports $915 million in itemized charitable tax deductions [[cite:irs2017individual]].

The left axis of Figure [[fig:individual]] shows the total number of itemized tax returns at each income bracket in NM.
The right axis shows the average charitable deduction. 
Together, these two series give us a useful idea about the capacity of prospective philanthropists at each bracket.

#+name: fig:individual
#+CAPTION: *Itemized Returns and Average Contributions by Income Bracket in NM.*
[[./figures/individual_brackets.png]]

Not all donors itemize their contributions.
Comparing the total national amount of charitable deductions with Giving USA's 2017 number for total individual donations indicates that about 10.6% of contributions do not show up on itemized tax returns.
Assuming this ratio also holds for NM, we would expect that the actual amount of individual giving is closer to $1.023 billion.

* Token Ibis Team
This section lists the individuals running Token Ibis.
We are fortunate to have already received so much help from numerous collaborators, many of whom are remote [[fig:map]].
Moving forward, our board of directors will provide the primary labor with other satellite volunteers on retainer as needed.

We are always looking for more volunteers and experienced community members who are willing to serve an advisory roles.

[[./figures/volunteer_locations.png]]

** Motivation
Token Ibis will continue to be volunteer-run until the organization's demands exceed our volunteer's capabilities.
In the current model, however, we are able to ensure that 100% of donations go to more established organizations.
In the world of shameless idealism, there are radical ideas, and there are radical ideas that are actionable.
As long as we are right about the value of UBP, the work will server as a strong foundation for others to build on.
This our chance to be at the start of something much, much bigger.

* Funding Proposition
Unlike other organizations, Token Ibis has a highly fluid fundraising model. 
Thanks to our heavy reliance on automation, a flexible economic model, and streamlined organizational structure, we don't have any hard capital needs.
Our operational costs are negligible, and our board has committed to enough bare-minimum funding so Token Ibis can move meaningful philanthropy money (at least $2,000 per month) indefinitely.

You can think of Token Ibis as a hyper-efficient engine for converting dollars into impact.
The more money we feed in, the more populations we will be able to reach, and the more social profit comes out of the other side.
We don't want to be one of the ways you give back to the community, we want to be /the/ way.

** Donation Tiers
We are deeply grateful for donors of all capacities and currently recognize seven different giving tiers listed in Table [[tab:tiers]].

#+name: tab:tiers
#+CAPTION: *Donation Tiers.*
|---------------+------------|
| Tier          | Amount ($) |
|---------------+------------|
| Ibis          |          1 |
| Hoatzin       |          4 |
| Kakapo        |         64 |
| Kagu          |        256 |
| Firgatebird   |       1024 |
| Tragopan      |       4092 |
| Secretarybird |      16384 |
|---------------+------------|

For contributions that do /not/ fit in exactly one of these levels, we can easily break down the gift into smaller chunks and honor every dollar at the appropriate bird denomination.
Each tier amount is a power of four.

** Fractal Donor Recognition
At Token Ibis, we like to do just about everything a little bit differently.
One of our more fun side projects is /fundraising fractals/: a graphical method to publicly thank contributors.
Figure \ref{fig:fractal} displays a fractal with real donations that we have secured.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{figure*}[t] \centering
  \includegraphics[clip, width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/fractal}
  \caption{\textbf{Fundraising Fractal.}}
  \label{fig:fractal}
\end{figure*}
#+END_EXPORT

Fractals provide a mathematically precise way to show off our entire support base in one unified picture.
The visual has some interesting traits:

1. Triangle sizes proportionally represent contribution sizes, allowing us to properly recognize our most generous major donors.
2. Earlier contributions will always maintain their spot in the center of the growing image, allowing us to remember our earliest supporters.
3. No matter how big or small, every contribution has a unique location in the fractal, allowing us to show that every single person has a role to play the world that we aim to build.

** Conclusion
Above all else, our bird-themed fractal system illustrates one final important point.
Token Ibis is not in the business of solving a single problem or fulfilling a single local need.
Our mission is to take a philanthropic vision and give it wings to soar to unprecedented heights.
This fun graphic allows us to celebrate every step of an exciting new journey.

At the beginning of this document, we promised that every dollar you donate will count twice: once to fund social profit, and once to build a new model for tomorrow.
Token Ibis is in the business of creating a world where social impact belongs to everyone.
With your help, we can start right here in the 505.
