#+BEGIN_abstract
Token Ibis Inc. is currently in an early foundation-building phase. We
are devoting our efforts to creating ideas, software, marketing
materials, and outreach toward the local nonprofit community. Thus
far, our work has resulted in a website, ongoing software and IT
infrastructure of for a web application, a whitepaper, which we have
submitted for publication, and various internal documents outlining
strategy and resources for upcoming endeavors. In the immediate
future, the work will be shifting toward an effort to generate
user-friendly media content to build the intellectual foundation while
developing a community of individuals interested in the mission.

* Past Activities
Token Ibis Inc. devoted much initial activity toward refining the
mission, especially in the context of the ambitious movement that we
are attempting to create. The culmination of this effort was the
completion of the first draft of a paper on /Universal Basic
Philanthropy/, which is provided in the standalone Attachment IV. In
parallel, we have made progress toward creating more accessible
content to relay the general concept through our website and in-person
canvassing. A screenshot of the website front page is provided in
Figure [[fig:website]].

Finally, the volunteer base of Token Ibis Inc. has grown rapidly and
the organization has taken deliberate steps to ensure all volunteers
are well-versed in understanding the subject area.

* Present Activities
Presently, we are concentrating most of our effort toward developing
the web application that users will use to interact with the Token
Ibis Inc. payment and media platform. This task involves the following
type of work:
- Graphic and UI/UX design
- Backend IT configuration
- Application software development
Sample screenshots of the current product is provided in Figure

* Planned Activities
The immediate plan of Token Ibis Inc. going forward is to continue
development of the web application while initializing a push toward
community building and content. In particular, we will direct most of
our available volunteer time toward generating content in the
following formats:
- Social media posts
- News articles
- Blog posts
- Short videos
- Podcast episodes
The purpose of this thrust is to document the development of the
movement while building an active community of like-minded volunteers
and readers. From there, we can draw upon the community for users,
fundraising sources, and to spread general awareness. Once these steps
have been completed, Token Ibis Inc. will be in a position to begin
the core mission of operating a scalable, ethical, and scientifically
sound experimentation to study the application of /Universal Basic
Philanthropy/.
